# Getting Started with Redux - React App

Welcome to our E-commerce project!

Our project is a React-Redux application that simulates an online shopping experience. It's built using modern web technologies such as React, Redux, and React Bootstrap.

The main objective of this project is to learn and practice state management with Redux. Our application is composed of various components that are connected to the Redux store. We have implemented actions and reducers to update the application state.

Our E-commerce project is designed to provide an easy and intuitive shopping experience for the user. The application consists of a catalog that displays various products, each with its own details, prices, and images. The user can add products to the shopping cart and then proceed to checkout.

We have implemented various functionalities such as filtering products by category, sorting them by price and name, and a search feature to find specific products. Additionally, the user can view their order history and edit their personal information.

Our project uses React Bootstrap to provide a modern, professional, and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes. We have optimized the application for a great user experience.

Overall, this project aims to showcase our skills in React and Redux development while providing a practical and enjoyable e-commerce experience.
